problem: `make install` requires a working ruby with a working psych module. psych.so depends on libyaml-0.so.2. i don't want to inflate binaries by adding a bunch of DT_RPATH/DT_RUNPATH entries, one for each dependency; i'd prefer to have a single directory that symlinks to all of the dependencies and a single DT_RPATH/DT_RUNPATH entry for that single directory. but then the libyaml-0.so.2 symlink would have to be in the cube dir before we can run `make install`, which prevents us from installing to a staging directory.

we could have that runpath directory be a separate package, but that would be really annoying at scale.

options:
1. add a separate package just for Ruby's runpath, and make it a dependency of the main Ruby package.
2. reimplement `make install` in a way that doesn't depend on the psych module.
3. eliminate all shared library dependencies except for libc stuff.

can't just remove the rubygems module from the source dir. apparently `make install` requires it. :(

yep, extmk.rb requires rubygems, and extmk.rb seems to be an integral part of `make install`.

1 would be okay. 2 sound too hard. 3 sounds too hard.
